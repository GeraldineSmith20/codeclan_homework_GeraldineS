--CTE's and Window Functions

--Common table expressions (ANSII SQL in 1999)
--CTE = temporary table that exists whilst another query is running
--use the temporary table inside another query
--CTE's = 'WITH' queries

--Add a column for each employee showing the ratio of their salary to the average salary of their team.
